## Simple Accordions

Let's work on **Accordion1**, then **Accordion2** and finally **Accordion3**.

Remember, we must build an **object** that represents our data state and a **render** function that redraws the screen from this state

-

For those of you who want a challenge, consider the **dragging** exercise as well.
