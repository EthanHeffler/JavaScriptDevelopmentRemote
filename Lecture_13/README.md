## Agenda

1. Build a simple popup window
2. Giphy search engine

## Warmup

First, let's begin by building a simple popup window. You can start with this HTML **[boilerplate](https://github.com/FEWDMaterials/boilerplate-plain)**

ðŸ‘‡

-

**Requirements**

* On clicking a button, display popup window that is displayed above everything else on screen
* Window should have an **x** button somewhere that allows user to close window
* Clicking on button again should reopen window

Here are the main features we would like to accomplish in our UI.

ðŸ‘‡

-

### Set up

Please clone **[this](https://github.com/FEWDMaterials/boilerplate-plain)** github repo.

-

### First Pass

* Input field for querying Giphy API
* On button click **or** enter key press, trigger a function call that starts timer (stubbing API call for now)
* When timer runs out, display something on the screen

-

### Second Pass

* Read and grok **[Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/)** docs
* Pull in a sample API response and use that to mock a single result set in browser
* IE: regardless of what user types in, always display results for a certain query (ie: pandas, let's say) to the browser window (with the images rendering)

-

### Third Pass

* Figure out how to make API calls in javascript
* Make an appropriate API call to giphy search API to display real results to browser
