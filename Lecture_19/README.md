### Agenda

As you present, answer the following:

* What does the project do? Click around and demonstrate the basic usecase of your app
* What was tough? How did you solve it?
* Did you use any neat plugins or APIs? Do tell!

### How I Chose Order

```js
const everyone = ['Dan', 'Alex', 'Brandy', 'Ellen', 'Ross', 'Patrick', 'Shari'];
everyone.sort();
console.log(everyone);
// ["Alex", "Brandy", "Dan", "Ellen", "Patrick", "Ross", "Shari"]
```

* Brandy
* Dan
* Ellen

## React primer

We will primarily focus on these three links:

* **[React Start](https://reactjs.org/docs/try-react.html)**
* **[Quick Start](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)**
* **[Introduction](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)**

-

In particular, we will update our **[CRUD app](https://github.com/mottaquikarim/JavaScriptDevelopmentRemote/tree/master/Lecture_17/class_notes/crud)** to leverage React instead of our DOM manipulation.

**NB:** ok to call **[renderComponent multiple times.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25728314/pass-updated-data-to-root-component)**
