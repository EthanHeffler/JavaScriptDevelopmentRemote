## Objectives

* Get **really**, **really** good at functions

## Quick Note

This lecture is extraneous. Due to everyone's stuggle with grokking functions, I have decided to take another day to make sure we all *really* get them. Functions form the backbone of the rest of programming and having a good understanding of them will make you a much better javascript programmer.
