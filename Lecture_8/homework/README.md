# Homework #2

## DUE: Mon Jan 8th, Midnight

## Assignment: jQuery Practice

Consider **[this repo](https://github.com/FEWDMaterials/javascript_psets)**. Download and open the **jQuery_review** folder. Complete the **selectorsReview.js** file.

We solved it before without **jQuery** , now solve again **with** jQuery. If you're feeling good about this, also solve **basicMethodsReview.js**


To submit, push the entire folder (the **jQuery_review** folder **ONLY**) to a github repo and link us to that repo. You code should have console.logs that show up when we open the `index.html` page.
